About
====

I got tired of replicating the same vim settings for all the computers I use. Hence this project. If you want to use it for your own projects, you're welcome to do so.
This project has been used in various versions of Linux, BSD and OS X (on MacVim)

Usage
====

After cloning the repository at a location say $HOME/vim-config, you want to make symbolic links of vim to $HOME/.vim and vimrc to $HOME/.vimrc
